# How diversity, inclusion, and belonging looks in the tech industry
* The tech industry is predominantly white and male, which has historically made it challenging for underrepresented minorities to gain a foothold in leadership.

* This is the second in our three-part series on diversity, inclusion and belonging. Part one focuses on GitLab's goals and efforts to date.

* It’s no secret that the tech industry has stumbled, struggled, and in some cases outright failed when it comes to building inclusive workplaces where women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and other underrepresented groups are adequately represented. And how can they, when the majority of people working in and leading tech companies are white men?

# Diversity has business value
* The main question here is why, when homogeneity in the workforce has been shown to be a losing strategy? There is plenty of anecdotal evidence and empirical research from Harvard Business Review that shows heterogeneous teams bring gains while homogeneous teams create costs.

* In a conversation between Marcus Carter, senior sales recruiter at GitLab, and Ryan O’Nell, VP of commercial sales at GitLab, Ryan said that his commitment to diversity comes from past experience that shows diverse teams are simply better at problem-solving than homogeneous teams. Hard evidence supports this assertion: Heterogeneous teams focus on facts, they process those facts more carefully and create more innovative solutions, writes David Rock and Heidi Grant of the Neuroleadership Institute in the Harvard Business Review (HBR).

* It seems simple: Diverse teams drive better business results, so hire more diverse team members – but to focus solely on recruitment is short-sighted.

# Unfairness pushes too many underrepresented minorities out of tech
* Six years after the first round of diversity commitments, big tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Twitter are pledging to do more to promote diversity and inclusion, and are donating millions to social justice initiatives and organizations supporting the Black community after public outcry following the killing of George Floyd, according to an article from CNBC. However, despite these donations and commitments, the article said progress has been slow with increasing representation of Black professionals in leadership and technical roles in many major tech companies, which continue to be lead predominately by white men.

# Everybody wins when diversity, inclusion, and belonging becomes a top priority
* DIB strategies look different at different companies, based upon the culture, values, and growth stage. But regardless of these different factors, all companies everywhere benefit from taking an intentional approach to integrating DIB strategies into every level of the business. Unfairness, stereotyping, and a lack of opportunity for professional growth are just some of the reasons why talented people from underrepresented groups voluntarily leave their jobs in the tech industry. Until DIB is prioritized alongside other important business targets, attrition of talented folks is likely to continue.
