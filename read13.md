# Client/server architecture
* At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

# On the client side: defining how to send the data
* The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.

# The action attribute
* The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form â€” the current page.

# The method attribute
* The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method

* To understand the difference between those two methods, let's step back and examine how HTTP works. Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.
