# EJS
* EJS simply stands for Embedded JavaScript templates, and we can use it both server-side or client-side. At this story, weâ€™ll focus on the server-side.

* EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

* Basic Syntax(Tags):
* <% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
* <%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
* <%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
